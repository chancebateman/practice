            <h3>Hello Data Street,</h3>

            <p>
                My name is Chance Bateman. I graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Mathematics Education. As a student, I needed an extra class to fill my schedule. I've always been good with computers and had some coding experience from my Linear Algebra class, so I decided to take Intro to Web Development. The class was so much fun that I was almost constantly thinking of new ideas to try on the webpage we were building, and I don't remember any of the other classes I took that semester.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, I learned nothing from that experience and stuck with education as my major. I graduated, taught math for a year in Atlanta, GA, then moved back to Alabama and got my current job with AAACooper Transportation. Meanwhile, web development sat as a dusty skill in my brain. I began dusting off those skills once I realized my current job was not the career I was looking for, and I've just been waiting for an opportunity to join a team like yours.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you hire me, it would be my first experience as a professional developer, but I built this page for my resume to show that I do have the skills you need. I've just never shown them off before. I can bring websites to life, and I'd love to do so for you and your clients.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for you consideration,
            </p>
