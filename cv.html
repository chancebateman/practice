            <h3>Hello Data Street,</h3>

            <p>
                My name is Chance Bateman. I graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Mathematics Education. As a student, I needed an extra class to fill my schedule. I've always been good with computers and had some coding experience from my Linear Algebra class, so I decided to take Intro to Web Development. The class was so much fun that I was almost constantly thinking of new ideas to try on the webpage we were building, and I don't remember any of the other classes I took that semester.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, I learned nothing from that experience and stuck with education as my major. I graduated, taught math for a year in Atlanta, GA, then moved back to Alabama and got my current job with AAACooper Transportation. Meanwhile, web development sat as a dusty skill in my brain. I began dusting off those skills once I realized my current job was not the career I was looking for, and I've just been waiting for an opportunity to join a team like yours.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am in fact Quinn's younger brother. I'm not yet the developer that he is because I've only ever coded as a hobby. On the 'About Me' page you will find information unrelated to job qualifications, but just to show I'm serious about turning web development into my career you should be able to recognize my attempt to copy the home page of your website. I'd love to join your team. Thank you for your consideration.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sincerly,
            </p>
